# Bilayer shells

Implements the 4th order Swift-Hohenberg equation on arbitrary surfaces using C1 Loop subdivision surface finite elements. An much extended version of this code was used for 
N. Stoop et al., Nature Materials 14, 337â€“342 (2015)

Make sure you first set up all environment variables (SETUP_ENV) according to your system setup.

Required libraries:
- Libmesh (see my other repo for a customized version)
- PETSc
- VTK (to output results)

The provided parameter file sh.in can be used as an example simulation file solving the Swift-Hohenbwerg equations on a spherical surface (as provided by mesh file sphere_rad1.off). Adapt to your liking!
Compile, then run the code by invoking

./biharmonic-opt

The file will automatically read parameters from the sh.in input file.
